This is my first time building a page using **CSS Flexbox**.

This project is a landing page template built with CSS Flexbox for layout. It includes four main sections, each using different font sizes, the same font family, and varying padding/margin sizes, as well as different flex directions and alignments.

**Note:** All files and directories were accessed, created, and edited via the macOS Terminal using Git â€” no IDE assistance. *(The project was written in VS Code.)*
